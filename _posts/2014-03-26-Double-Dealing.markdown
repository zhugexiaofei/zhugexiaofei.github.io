##教材版式特点：
在目录处有一个人物介绍列表，其中包含公司logo、教材中出现任务的头像图片、姓名以及公司职务。为本书内容带来真实感和戏剧感。

图书板块设计十分清晰规整。其中Start up、Business Vocabulary、Business Lanugage、Cross-Cultural Focus各占两面；Business Focus、Simulation、Review和Personal Data Bank各占一面，每单元总计共占12面。从学生自Start up开始看起，共翻5次书页可以看完该单元，其中翻前三次，每次视野中的两面构成一个板块，后面两次，每次视野中的两面包含两个板块。

另外值得注意的是各板块的板块名称都是在页眉处显示，不占用主干区域的版面。主干区域各板块开头都是以标号1开始，引领本板块的第一个练习。因此，虽然练习形式多种多样、插图、背景色等也很丰富，但是版心部分就是以练习题组成，没有其余信息，醒目的各练习题题号有效地引导了读者的视觉感受，使得排版复杂，但脉络清晰，不显杂乱。

本书也采用了惯用的，包含听力的练习，在题号前有CD图标。
